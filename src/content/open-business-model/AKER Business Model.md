# **AKER Operations**

## Legal

### Founding & State Registration

**Link**: [State of Colorado Business Incorporation](https://www.sos.state.co.us/biz/FileDocNameAvailCriteria.do?transTyp=ARTORG_LLC)

AKER is set up as a *Limited Liability Company*. We filed *Articles of Incorporation* with the [Colorado Secretary of State](https://www.sos.state.co.us/biz/FileDocNameAvailCriteria.do?transTyp=ARTORG_LLC) and paid a $50 filing fee ([fee schedule](http://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/info_center/fees/business.html)). This can all be done online, they provide a standard template for you to fill out, and the whole process takes about 20 minutes.

### Federal Registration

**Link**: [IRS Employer Identification Number Registration](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online)

LLCs are required to register with the IRS and are given an *Employer Identification Number* (EIN). You can file online [here](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online) for free, and it takes about 15 minutes. You receive your EIN right away.

### Legal Structure & Operating Agreement

**Template**: [Operating Agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E9ytwONhVOc-fwhYyxeekJipqMIEv2QGfsrnGVfRg34/edit?usp=sharing)

A LLC is a hybrid legal business structure that provides limited liability, while still maintaining much of the flexibilities of a partnership. Owners of an LLC (known as members) may be an individual, group of individuals, corporations, or other LLC’s. The federal government does not recognize LLC’s as a business entity for tax purposes, and as such LLC’s must file taxes as either a corporation, partnership, or sole proprietorship. In order to form a LLC, one must choose a business name, file “articles of organization”, create an operating agreement and obtain the necessary licenses and permits.

The greatest advantage of an LLC is that members benefit from limited liability, meaning that they are not held personally liable for business decisions or debts of the LLC. Additionally, this business structure requires less record keeping and facilitates easier sharing of profits than corporations. Disadvantages of an LLC include that they have a limited life, meaning (in many cases) that they must be dissolved if a member leaves the business and also that members must pay taxes on the net income of the LLC, as if they were self employed. More info on LLC’s can be found [here](https://www.sba.gov/starting-business/choose-your-business-structure/limited-liability-company).

### Sales Licences & Wage Witholding License

**Link**: [Colorado Sales Tax License Application](https://apps.colorado.gov/apps/jboss/cbe/index.xhtml;jsessionid=5S1cpowKiOqArBAcChv1GA__)

**Link**: [City of Denver Sales Tax License Application](https://www.denvergov.org/content/dam/denvergov/Portals/571/documents/NewTaxpayerRegistrationForm.pdf)

**Link**: [Colorado Department of Revenue Online](https://www.colorado.gov/revenueonline/_/)

We were required to get a *sales tax license* for the State of Colorado as well as the City of Denver. You can easily file for a state sales license online [here](https://apps.colorado.gov/apps/jboss/cbe/index.xhtml;jsessionid=5S1cpowKiOqArBAcChv1GA__), and you can file for a city sales tax license [here](https://www.denvergov.org/content/dam/denvergov/Portals/571/documents/NewTaxpayerRegistrationForm.pdf). We file sales taxes on a quarterly basis with the [Colorado Department of Revenue](https://www.colorado.gov/revenueonline/_/).

When you file for a sales tax license, you also receive a *Colorado Account Number* (CAN) that you'll use as an employer.

## Materials & Finishes

### General Requirements: Plywood

Plywood kits can last for years, even in outdoor conditions (boats are often made with *Marine Plywood*). These are our ideal properties:

* *Exterior-grade*: phenolic resins
* *No Added Urea Formaldehydes (NAUF)*
* *FSC-Certified or equivalent*: responsibly managed forests
* *High Ply Count*: 9 plies (layers) on 0.5"/12mm 
* *Domestically-sourced*: smaller carbon footprint & easier to audit
* *Void-free*: machined sections will be consistent
* *Light-weight*: less costs when shipping


#### Current Plywood: Baltic Birch

AKER manufactures its products primarily using a 4’ x 8’ x ½”, Grade BB, 9 ply, FSC Certified Baltic Birch. Our current supplier is [National Wood Products](http://nationalwood.com/). Baltic Birch is a plywood native to North Eastern Europe, near the Baltic Sea. Unlike many plywood’s, the inner plies of Baltic Birch are 1.5 mm-thick solid birch veneer, cross-banded, and laminated with exterior grade adhesive.

According to [Wood Worker Source](http://www.woodworkerssource.com/blog/woodworking-101/tips-tricks/your-ultimate-guide-to-baltic-birch-plywood-why-its-better-when-to-use-it/), as well as our own experience, there are several properties of Baltic Birch that make it uniquely suitable for our products, as well as for other woodworking endeavors. First and foremost, while most plywood’s use an inferior wood on inner plies, Baltic Birch inner plies are made up of birch veneers which results in a virtually void free (no gaps) core, which makes for superior screw holding. Additionally the solid birch veneers make for stable joinery that is both structurally sound and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, while all woods run the risk of warping, the cross-banded layers of 1.5 mm thick birch veneer makes the sheets balanced, which reduces this risk and makes for a significantly flatter product.

At AKER, we use a grade BB/BB Baltic Birch, meaning that both the front and back veneers are made up of a single piece and allow for 3-6 small color-matched patches on average and some light mineral streaks. The inner cores of BB/BB are solid single piece veneers. You can learn more about the different grades of plywood [here](http://woodworking.about.com/od/plywood/p/PlywoodGrades.htm) or [here](http://www.ezwoodshop.com/plywood/plywood-grades.html)

Another important factor to consider when choosing a plywood is whether you will want interior or exterior grade glue lines. If you want to use your product outdoors (as AKER does), you must be sure to get plywood that has an exterior grade adhesive. Within the category of exterior grade glues, there are several different types. AKER chooses to use a plywood with a Phenolic Resin Adhesive, as it creates a stronger bond as compared to urea based resins. More info on different adhesives can be found [here](http://blog.positiveindians.in/plywood/adhesives-for-plywood.html).

AKER is proud to say that the Baltic Birch we use is FSC Certified. A Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) Certification ensures that products come from well managed forests that provide environmental, social and economic benefits. Whenever possible, AKER strives to use FSC certified wood to minimize the environmental impact from the creation of our products. More information on the FSC Certification can be found [here](https://us.fsc.org/en-us/certification) Overall, FSC Certified Baltic Birch is a uniquely suitable for our products in that it is sustainable, durable and aesthetically pleasing.

### General Requirements: Sealers

Ideal properties for wood sealers:

* *FDA/USDA Compliant*:
* *Non-Toxic*: 
* *ASMT Tests*: passes ASTM testing
* *VOC Free*: free from the offgassing of volatile organic compounds
* *Lead Free*: no lead present
* *Formaldehyde Free*: no formaldehydes present

#### Current Sealer: TriCoPolymer
After researching and testing multiple wood seals on our products, TriCoPolymer Hive Seal has been shown to be the best in terms of sustainability. Hive Seal dries clear and is eco-friendly, non-toxic, non-hazardous, non-flammable, non-corrosive, non-leaching and does not emit any Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC’s). It has been proven to be safe for animals, including Bees and is USDA/FDA compliant. Many of TriCoPolymer’s products can be bought from [homedepot.com](http://www.homedepot.com/p/TriCoPolymer-VOC-Free-Non-Toxic-Lumber-Seal-1-gal-Clear-Satin-Wood-Sealer-LS128/203322573) or [amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dtools&field-keywords=tricopolymer), while specialty products such as their Hive Seal can only be found at [Agralifeproducts.com](http://agralifeproducts.com/products/specialty-sealants).  You can see the general TriCoPolymer MSDS [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzmpC52tSYTKTzJJcG1SWUlQaHM/view?usp=sharing).


##### Alternative Materials
Currently, AKER is experimenting with a number of sustainable materials to ensure that our products are as environmentally friendly as possible. We will outline these materials below.


- **MycoBoard**: According to the [Evocative Website](http://www.ecovativedesign.com/myco-board), “MycoBoard™ products are a biofabricated, certified sustainable, form of engineered wood. They are grown using mycelium – “nature’s glue” – which is formaldehyde-free, safe, and healthy and produces panels that are strong, machinable and fire-resistant.” Currently the MycoBoard team is producing custom printed shapes and 3’ x 6’ sheets on their own presses and have partnered with mills in North America to create 4’ x 8’ and 5’ x 10’ panels in greater volumes. AKER hopes to incorporate this mushroom based sustainable material into its products in the near future. You can learn more about MycoBoard [here](http://www.ecovativedesign.com/myco-boardhttp://www.ecovativedesign.com/myco-board).


- **Smile Plastics**: Smile Plastics are hand made plastic sheets created entirely from recycled plastics. These high end plastics come in a number of unique colors and designs and the sheets are fully machineable. AKER has used a sheet of Smile Plastics on the prototypes of some of its products, but currently their prices are prohibitively expensive to use on all of our products. You can see a picture of AKER’s products made with Smile Plastics on our [twitter page](https://twitter.com/akerkits/status/761633215505281024) and learn more about their plastics at [smile-plastics.com](http://www.smile-plastics.com/about-us/).


- **Richlite**: Richlite is an eco friendly, FSC Certified, paper based composite material. According to their website, richlite.com, "Richlite works similar to a dense hardwood and can be easily milled, sanded, routed, and joined. Richlite is water-resistant, sanitary, has low moisture absorption, heat and fire resistant [and is] extraordinarily dense and durable.” AKER hopes to produce products using Richlite in the near future.


- **Krion**: In many ways, Krion seems similar to stone, however, unlike stone, it is fully machineable using a CNC Router. According to [Krion.com](http://www.krion.com/en/what-is-krion), it is "made of two-thirds natural minerals (ATH – aluminum trihydride) and a low percentage of high-resistance resins. This composition gives KRION™ a number of exclusive features: it does not have any pores, it is anti-bacterial without any type of additive, it is hard-wearing, highly resistant and easy to repair, only requires minimum maintenance and is easy to clean." AKER has successfully engraved a test sheet of Krion, and would like to experiment more with this material moving forward.


### Manufacturing
##### Products
AKER designs its products in Solid Works, then manufactures its products using CNC routers. All of our products are flat-packed and snap together without any tools. By flat-packing our products, AKER is able to cut down on the environmental impact generated during transport.


##### CNC Routing
AKER manufacturers its products primarily using CNC Routers. For those unfamiliar with Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) Routing we will include some details and resources to get you started. CNC Routing uses computer aided designs and a router bit to precision cut along x and y-axises. Most CNC routers can also cut (to varying degrees) along a z-axis in order to vary the depth of cuts and make 3D products and parts. More about CNC routing can be found [here](http://www.cncroutersource.com/cnc-wood-router.html) or [here](http://www.shopbottools.com/mProducts/WhatsCNC.htm).


CNC Routing is particularly suitable for AKER products due to the dispersed networks of FabLabs where the general public can learn about the process, then use CNC routers to fabricate AKER’s products for themselves. You can find out more about FabLabs and see where they are located on their website. If you do not see a FabLab in your area, it is with looking for other MakerSpaces (community work spaces), many of which have CNC Routers.


##### Colorado CNC
In order to manufacturer our products, AKER has partnered with [Colorado CNC](http://www.coloradocnc.com/), based out of Broomfield, Colorado. They have been excellent in every regard and nothing but a pleasure to work with. The CNC router used by Colorado CNC has a maximum part size of 12' x 6' x 5" and a minimum part size of .25" x .25" x .25" with precision guaranteed to +/- .005". However, it is important to note that the specs will vary depending on the software and hardware that your manufacturer is using.


To form our partnership with Colorado CNC, we created a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that both parties agreed to.  A MOU is a non binding agreement between two parties that outlines the terms and details of a relationship between those parties including each party's' requirements and responsibilities. While it is not legally binding, a “MOU should describe who the parties are, what the project is they are agreeing on, the scope of the document and each party's' roles and responsibilities” (read more at [Investopedia.com](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mou.asp)). A MOU is often created prior to formalizing the document as a contract. Feel free to use [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r48zzZsADdXV_JIbrmml4FuLKQFxdAYn1gEjE77Ksyo/edit?usp=sharing) template made from AKER’s MOU with our manufacturer, which we later formalized into a contract.


### Packaging
As part of AKER’s commitment to protecting the environment, we have made a point of sourcing our packaging from [Tharco](http://www.packagingcorp.com/tharco-stock-boxes), a Packaging Corp of America (PCA) brand, whenever possible. Their boxes are manufactured in many locations around the country and are offered in a variety of sizes which enables us to cut down on waste in the packaging of our products. Additionally, over 95% of PCA products are produced according to [Sustainable Forestry Initiative®](http://www.packagingcorp.com/managed-forestry) (SFI®) standards. By using packaging that is [SFI certified](http://www.packagingcorp.com/managed-forestry), AKER can be certain that PCA gets it fiber from sources that practice active management of water quality and wildlife habitats, and protect biodiversity.


##### Tharco Stock boxes
Here is the [Tharco Stock Box Catalogue](http://www.packagingcorp.com/filebin/pdf/Tharco_Catalog_2016-06.pdf) for your convenience. Tharco boxes come in packs of 10-25. The minimum order is $100 and there is free shipping on orders greater than $350.


##### Box Durability Standards
When choosing what box to use, one must consider how durable the box must be. Within the corrugated industry, their are two [standards](http://salazarpackaging.com/the-difference-between-200-test-and-32ect-corrugated/) for measuring the durability of boxes.


- The Mullen Test: A test of the bursting strength or more precisely, how much pressure is required to rupture the wall of a piece of corrugated material (the greater the number, the greater the strength). All of Tharco’s stock boxes are #200 on the Mullen Test.


- The Edge Crush Test: A test that measures the stacking strength of corrugated packaging, or in other words, how much top to bottom pressure a box can withstand before crushing. All of Tharco’s stock boxes are 32 or greater on the Edge Crush Test, which means they can withstand 32 pounds of pressure stacked on the edge of the box


### Shipping & Logistics
For many small businesses (and larger ones for that matter), shipping and logistics can present numerous problems, which is why we at AKER want to share some of our strategies with you. At least initially, most businesses will handle their shipping themselves; however, there are several tools that can help you along the way. At AKER, we rely on several, including Shipstation, Shipwire and a UPS Small Business Solutions Account. These tools and their useful features are outlined below.


##### Shipstation
[Shipstation](http://www.shipstation.com/) is a very useful software for automating the shipping and handling of orders from multiple ecommerce platforms including Amazon, Shopify and Ebay. Shipstation can import orders, then automatically generate shipping labels and find the cheapest option for shipping your products across the various carriers. Additionally every Shipstation user is provided with a stamps.com account through which they can receive significant discounts on USPS shipping. Their prices start at $9 per month and there are numerous price tiers, so shipstation can grow along with your business. You can find more information on shipstation pricing and features [here](http://www.shipstation.com/pricing/).


##### Shipwire
As a business grows, it can be useful to set up warehouses in multiple locations for a more efficient and environmentally friendly distribution system. A worthwhile tool for doing this is [Shipwire](https://www.shipwire.com/). Shipwire is a global commerce and fulfillment platform that can fully automate inbound logistics, storage, packaging and outbound shipping of all of your products. Additionally, by using a Shipstation integration with Shipwire, one can automate the entire distribution process; a process that begins with a customer placing an order and ends with the product being delivered at their door. Shipwire is a pay-as-you-go software with the only requirement being that you reach $500 in total billing per month (measured as the sum of your storage, handling, and shipping), after the initial 90 day grace period. More on Shipwire can be found [here](https://www.shipwire.com/w/support/billing-payments-deposits/).


##### UPS Small Business Solutions
If you do not want to pay for shipping automation software, a useful (and free) tool is a UPS small business account. With a UPS account, you can: schedule day-specific or daily pickups, manage shipping through a central company account, and receive volume discounts on shipping. These features in combination with general UPS features that allow you to store your address book online, print labels, and request tracking notifications, can make a UPS Account an effective way for small businesses to handle their shipping and logistics needs. More on opening a UPS business account can be found [here](https://www.ups.com/content/us/en/bussol/browse/ups-small-business/ups-shipping-account.html).


##### Fulfillment by Amazon
While AKER does not currently use Fulfillment by Amazon, no discussion of shipping & logistics would be complete without it. According to the Amazon Website, “With Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA), you store your products in Amazon's fulfillment centers, and we pick, pack, ship, and provide customer service for these products”. Using FBA, you can ship your products to Amazon, and let them take care of the remainder of the ordering process. You can use FBA simultaneously with another online store, or use amazon as your sole ecommerce outlet. More info on Fulfillment by Amazon can be found [here](https://services.amazon.com/fulfillment-by-amazon/benefits.htm).


### Ecommerce
Ecommerce is essential for almost any business these days. AKER uses [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) as its primary ecommerce platform. Shopify allows users to build a fully customizable online store with automated checkout (including taxes), customer management and a blogging platform. You can visit our Shopify store at [Akerkits.com](https://akerkits.com/) to get a feel for the service they provide.


Shopify provides information on how to achieve your marketing and search engine optimization (SEO) goals. Furthermore, it provides sales analytics and web traffic reports so your business can better understand its customers. Shopify has a tiered pricing system starting an $29 per month so it is suitable for all small/medium sized businesses. More on Shopify pricing and features can be found [here](https://www.shopify.com/).


### Marketing
Currently, AKER relies on Social Media as its primary marketing tool. Specifically, AKER utilizes Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to engage with potential customers and other members of the public interested in our brand.


Other marketing outlets that AKER hopes to explore in the near future are, Google+, LinkedIn and Pinterest. Each of these social networks has attributes (including demographics) that make them uniquely suited to different types of business.  A successful social media strategy can lead to increased website traffic, brand awareness, customer service and ultimately sales. For your convenience, demographics and other information on these networks will be included below. There is much more to social media marketing than one might expect, so you can find further reading on this topic [here](http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/7832-social-media-for-business.html) or [here](http://www.wordstream.com/social-media-marketing) as well as a number of other locations on the internet.


##### Facebook
With over 1.7 Billion active users, this social media site is essential for any small business. You can use facebook to share pictures, videos, company updates and any information that you want. Additionally you can include contact info and other details so that customers can more easily connect with your business. More and more businesses these days are using facebook to provide superior customer service, as it is one of the easiest ways for consumers to reach out and interact with a business. If your business does not have a Facebook page that at a minimum includes a company contact, a link to your website, as well as photos of what your business does, you are missing a large marketing and sales opportunity. More info on Facebook marketing can be found [here](http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/tag/facebook-marketing/) and you can visit the AKER Facebook page at facebook.com/akerkits/.


##### Twitter
Twitter has over 320 million active users worldwide and is another essential network for any business. On twitter you can post just about anything, as long as the text is shorter than 140 characters. Twitter is a great network for customer service as it revolves around interactions and communication between its users. Additionally, twitter can be a great way to share frequent updates about your business. Using twitter you can follow other brands/people that operate in your industry and stay up to date on news that might affect your business. Also twitter allows you to connect with the people you follow and it is likely that many of them will begin to follow you (if you provide valuable content). More on the in’s and out’s of Twitter marketing can be found [here](https://mention.com/blog/twitter-marketing-content/) and you can visit the AKER Twitter page at twitter.com/akerkits.


##### Instagram
This network, which is owned by facebook, has over 400 million active users and is centered around posting images. As such, it is particularly useful for business that operate in the food, art, design, travel and fashion industries. Within this social media site, there is a significant focus on aesthetics, so if you determine this network is right for you, be sure to post unique and aesthetically pleasing photos (instagram helps you do this by including a number of filters and editing options). More about instagram marketing can be found [here](http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/instagram-marketing-guide/).


##### Pinterest
Pinterest is essentially a digital bulletin board where users can post content that they like, whether their own or others. Even more so than instagram, this social media site is geared towards visual content, as every post must be a picture or video. According to [businessnewsdaily.com](http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/7832-social-media-for-business.html), Pinterest's users are primarily women and popular content includes posts about DIY projects, fashion, exercise, beauty, photography and food. While pinterest is somewhat of a niche social media site, if you fall into this niche it may be essential for your business and even if you do not it can still be a valuable tool for uploading visual content about your brand. More on pinterest marketing can be found [here](http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/pinterest-marketing-guide/).


##### Linkedin
LinkedIn is a professional network and as such is particularly useful for communicating with others in your industry as well as for B2B businesses. Additionally, by establishing your brand on Linkedin, you can receive customer reviews and establish a good reputation. This network can also be very useful for finding contact information of others in your industry as well as in the hiring process. B2B companies should be sure to use linkedin, and it is also highly recommended for other businesses. It is important to note that this Linkedin should not be used to blatantly push your business or explicitly drive sales as it is against the culture of the site and can turn users of your brand. Nevertheless Linkedin can be a valuable tool for connecting with other businesses and individuals in your industry. More on linkedin marketing can be found [here](http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/7206-linkedin-marketing-business.html).


##### Google+
Google+ has been a rapidly growing social media platform that now has over 375 million active users. Using Google+ your business can create posts (generally in the form of short articles) that are very useful for Search Engine Optimization. As such, creating useful articles on Google+ can be a great way to drive users to your website. More information on marketing using Google+ can be found [here](http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/tag/google-plus/).


##### Social Media Management
As you can see, managing all of a business social media channels can be a daunting task. Fortunately there is software that makes it possible to manage all of your social networks from one dashboard. At AKER we have chosen to use [Hootsuite](https://hootsuite.com/) to engage, listen and get feedback from all of our social media networks. Hootsuite has options ranging from free to $99+ per month so it is suitable no matter the size of your business. Other social media management software includes Sprout Social, Agorapulse, Buffer and many others. A list of social media management software can be found [here](http://www.toprankblog.com/2015/07/social-media-marketing-tools/).


##### Analytics
In order to determine the efficacy of your social media marketing, you must analyze the results of your efforts, and adjust your strategy where necessary. [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/provision/?authuser=0#provision/SignUp/), [Facebook Audience Insights](https://www.facebook.com/business/news/audience-insights) and [Twitter Analytics](https://analytics.twitter.com/about) can be strong tools for this, as can analytics reports offered by the social media management software outlined above. These reports can help you determine details about your web traffic, brand engagement, as well as the profile of your audience and the overall effectiveness of your social media marketing strategy. This information should be used to adjust your marketing and branding in the future. More how to use social media marketing analytics can be found [here](http://www.razorsocial.com/social-media-analytics-tools/).
