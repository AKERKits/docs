## WormHaus Users Manual

The Aker WormHaus is a complete modular vermicomposting bin with up to four processing cells that enable airflow (and worm movement) through the system while keeping the worms and their castings where they belong.

### The Stacking Cells

Once you assemble your Worm Haus, you’ll have four individual cells which will contain your food wastes and bedding, as well as your worms.  You can set aside the top two or three cells and store them until your worm friends have processed the first (bottom) cell.  You should progressively fill each cell with layers of food waste and bedding.  Keep in mind that worms like it moist, so it would be advisable to lay newspaper or burlap over the bedding so as to retain moisture. You can also add water to the newspaper or burlap which will move downward into the composting area by capillary action. Allow each cell to process the entire waste supply and have it full before stacking the next layer on top.  The perforated bottoms of each cell provide the worms a pathway into the next cell you are filling.

### How Many Worms Do I Need and What Type?

There are a few schools of thought regarding how many worms to add.  The general rule of thumb is 1.0 lb/square foot and then let the population ‘grow’ into your system. One pound of redworms will easily take care of each half-pound of garbage. When you first set up your system, it would be good to help your first shot of worms along by chopping your food waste some, to keep the initial green waste more digestible to the worms.  As time goes on the ‘system’ will mature to include all the stages between fresh waste to finished castings. Composting Worms are small-900 to 1000 worms per pound. Start with about 1000 red wigglers or other red worms and observe how they’re doing.  Look for growth, and signs of reproduction in the form of cocoons. It doesn’t hurt to go with more at first.

### What to Add?

To start your worm farm, you’ll want to give it a bit of a boost.  Add some potting soil and maybe mix in some peat moss to set up the system for the worms to easily travel through. You don’t need much, just enough to get things started…maybe an equal volume to the amount of food waste you’re starting with. Then add some food waste and incorporate it into the starter ‘soil’.  Finally, you want to add your ‘bedding’.  This would be any paper product, preferably a mix of thicknesses (cardboard, newspaper, used printer paper, etc). Tear the paper down to about 1” square each to start with. As time goes on, your bedding can be larger. The worms will work on the bedding in time.  This should be applied over the top of your foodwaste and starter soil, perhaps blended in a little, but then have a layer of it over the top of the ‘mix’.  Always dampen your bedding before adding to the mix. You should probably dampen the entire batch pretty well at first, just don’t saturate it.  You want good airflow within the material to be composted by the worms.  Finally, spread your wigglers over the surface equally and let them work down into the material.  Soak some burlap or newspaper, and lay it over the top of the pile to keep critters in the mass, and retain moisture in the media. You should keep this cover moist all the time.  If in time you start noticing a strong odor coming from the bin, it’s probably going anaerobic (lacking oxygen) so you’ll want to perhaps not seal it with a cover over the pile; but just mix it up and if it gets too dry, add some water. Keep the lid of the unit on at all times to keep insects inside the waste.

### When are my Worms finished?

As the worms move upward through the bin, their castings will settle below.  You know it’s ‘done’ when it’s odorless (or smells like rich soil) and you can’t see what it originated as (the waste).  When you remove the finished compost, be sure to pick out any worms or cocoons that were left behind and put them in the new material you’re adding.

### Some common problems and things to remember:

Odors:  if the food waste is exuding excessive odor, increase your volume of bedding. If the odor is more of a ‘musty’ smell or ‘rotten egg’ smell; you need more air.  Stir the contents, reduce your watering frequency and amount, give it a few days and see if it improves.
Temperature: Redworms prefer temperatures between 55 and 77 degrees Fahrenheit and are suited to living in a worm bin. The temperature of the bedding should not be allowed to get below freezing or above 84 degrees.

Fuel:  Kitchen waste fed to worms can come from a variety of sources, including all vegetable and fruit waste (don't be surprised that some seeds may germinate and potato peels with eyes sprout), pasta leftovers, coffee grounds (with filter) and tea bags. Worms may have a problem with garlic and onion skins. Worms have a gizzard like chickens so fine grit should be added to help the worms digest food. This gritty material includes cornmeal, coffee grounds and/or finely crushed egg shells (dry the shells and then crush). Avoid large amounts of fat, meat scraps or bone. Some sources feel that a small amount of meat and eggs will provide protein to the worms, but be careful you don't overdo it and know that you may attract rodents.  It’s good to just avoid meat altogether.

### How Long Does it Take:

In about 3-4 months, the worms will have digested nearly all the garbage and bedding and the bin will be filled with a rich, black natural fertilizer and soil amendment. Compared to ordinary soil, the worm castings contain five times more nitrogen, seven times more phosphorus and 11 times more potassium. They are rich in humic acids and improve the structure of the soil. Use it like you would a fertilizer.

To keep your bin going, you will need to remove the castings from time to time and there are several ways to go about it. One way to do this is to shine a bright light into the bin. The worms are sensitive to light and will move to the lower layers of the bin. Remove the top layer of casting by using your hands or a sieve. Each time you remove some bedding, the worms will be exposed to the light and they will keep migrating down to the bottom of the bin. Pick out any wigglers or worm eggs (small, opaque cocoons) and return them to the bin. Refill the bin with fresh layers of moist bedding and food.
